checks that if a file named `sleep.ts` exists, then it must match the proper definition for our sleep utility, defined as a best practice

optional check => if you dont need `sleep.ts`, dont define the file

helpful in that:
- it makes sure your definition of sleep is correct
- you can just define an empty file called `sleep.ts` and then run `declapract fix --practice:util-sleep` and it will fill it out for you
