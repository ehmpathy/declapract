dont attempt to "fix" a version via @declapract{check.minVersion(

if the current veresion in the project is `link:.`

as `link:.` indicates that the current repo IS that package

and asks the package manager to use the latest version of the package => the latest in the repo

so, by definition, it's already satisfied
